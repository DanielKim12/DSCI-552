## Homework 0: Setting Up Python Environment

This homework involves setting up the Python environment and familiarizing with common libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn. It also introduces Git for version control and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

## Homework 1: Vertebral Column Data Set

The focus is on binary classification of vertebral column data using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). We explore various distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, and Mahalanobis. We also apply weighted voting for KNN and analyze error rates.

## Homework 2: Combined Cycle Power Plant Data

In this assignment, we use linear regression and KNN regression on the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset. We explore pairwise relationships between variables, fit multiple regression models, and test for nonlinear associations and interactions.
